Open packages.

Open working directory and load/label the data.
```{r}

#load the data
df <- read.spss("CTC12month.SAV", use.value.labels = TRUE, to.data.frame=TRUE)

names(df.labels) <- c("VAR_ID", "description")
rm(QDSlabels)

#USE THIS CODE TO LOOK UP A VARIABLE DESCRIPTION
#df.labels$description[df.labels$VAR_ID=="GENDER"]
```

Subset the data to delete all rows that are entirely NA (since they didn't show up to 12 month visit). This should be around
